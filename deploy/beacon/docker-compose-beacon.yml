  # Beacon DB doesn't need to expose any port outside of this container set, as
  # the only expected connection is from the "beacon" container, and thus there's
  # no need to expose port 5432 to the host's applications.
  #
  # Moreover, this way we can avoid collisions between host's pgsql installation
  # and containers'.
  #
  # If you want to reach pgsql from outside of the containers, uncomment the
  # "ports" clause and the indented line after it. If you want to change the
  # port that can be used outside of the container, set the mapping with the
  # HOST:CONTAINER structure (i.e.: 35432:5432) the host will listen on port
  # 35432 and will connect to pgsql container's port 5432.
  #
  # For more options and details, please, check out the docker documentation.
